### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± I am Mika. I am a software Engineering student at the University of Ottawa located in Ontario, Canada. My goal is to deepen my knowledge about software development, understand how technology impact our lives and create new software that would be useful for this world.

ðŸ”­ Since 16, I was always exploring anything that intersted me in new techs like the Iot, mobile apps, and any stuff that pings my curiosity

âœ¨ Tech Stack :
 
 -  Web development : HTML | CSS | Javascript | Typescript | React JS | Groovy Server Pages | Node JS | Express JS | Spring | API | RestAPI 
 -  Mobile development: Java | Kotlin | XML
 -  Software Development : Java | Groovy | Python | C++
 -  Version Control: Git/Github | Docker
 -  Databases: PostgreSQL | Firestore | SQLite
 -  Communication: TCP/IP | NFC
 -  Hardware : Arduino | Raspeberry Pi | Nucleo F446RE 

Progress : 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an NFC eNail app that changes the color of your nail to any picture or design you want. We are using an eInk screen to avoid the need of a battery and using an I2C to send data throughout the app to the nail.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Embedded system programming with <b>Arduino - Nucleo F446ERE<b>, I aim to create something meaningful that may have impact on everyday life using robotics and Hardware Engineering
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any Hardware engineering Project, I code in embedded C and have experience using Linux

âš¡ Fun fact: I hate boiled eggs.
